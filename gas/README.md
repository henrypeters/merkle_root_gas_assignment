### Gas 
Gas is a unit of measurement. It measures how much computation a transaction uses

### Gas Limit 
Gas limit is the maximum amount of gas you are willing to use for a transaction.

### Gas price
Gas price is how much ETH you pay per unit of gas. It's measured in gwei

### Burnt/Base Fee
Since EIP-1559, Ethereum splits the transaction fee into parts.
The Base Fee (Burnt Fee)
A base fee is calculated automatically by the network
It changes depending on network congestion
This base fee is burned (destroyed forever)
**Burned ETH is removed from circulation → makes ETH deflationary**
